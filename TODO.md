# TODO List for Practice Test Update

- [x] Update practice.html: Add input fields for student name, mobile number, and email before the questions.
- [x] Update app.py: Modify /submit-practice to send email with name, mobile, email, and marks instead of saving to CSV.
- [x] Remove admin panel routes and templates since no CSV storage.
- [x] Add negative marking: -1 mark for each wrong answer in multiple choice questions.
- [ ] Test the functionality: Submit form and check if email is sent with correct score calculation.
